## Stretch Mode

Add styling or extra functionality that fits with the theme of this assignment.

Once the employee is deleted, update the _Total Monthly Cost_ section on the page to reflect the employee's removal. _HINT:_ You will need to figure out which employee was removed, in order to subtract their salary from the total. Consider using `.text()` as a getter, or look into jQuery's `.data()` function. This is tricky! 

## Reminder About Modes

Above, we introduced the concept of levels of difficulty. "Mode" is how we will typically refer to each level. Below is a brief explanation of

* what to expect when attempting each mode
* if they are required or not

Mode | Description
--- | ---
Base | required
Stretch | optional, stretches your understanding and may require additional research
