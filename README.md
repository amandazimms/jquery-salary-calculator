# Project Name
Salary Calculator


## Description
This app allows you to input employee information, including first and last name, employee ID, job title, and annual salary. The information is stored in an object for each employee, and is displayed on the DOM via CSS Grid (the grid's rows have alternating background colors that dynamically update even when the row numbers change :) ). As employees are added, the monthly total cost of paying their salaries is updated, and indicates in red when the maximum of $20k is reached. Employees can be removed with a delete button, and the total updates as expected.
